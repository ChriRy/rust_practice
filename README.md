# Overview

These are a few programs designed in rust to help increase my familiarity with the language and boost my skills in using it. 
The hello_world and hello_cargo functions are simple starter programs to test the environment to make sure that it is working. The guessing game and hangman are both terminal games. The guessing game was built following the Rust Programming book while the hangman game was built by me.

# Development Environment

These projects are developed in VS Code using the rust language and the rust analyzer extension. Both of the games use std::io in order to accept input for the user. 

# Useful Websites

- [The Rust Programming Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/index.html)

# Future Work

- Better GUI (maybe one program to navigate to both games. 
- Guess limit feature for hangman (animation or ASCII art)
- Have the hangman game select a random word from a file instead of hardcoding the word
